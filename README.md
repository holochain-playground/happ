# Holochain Playground hApp

The Holochain Playground hApp will include these flows:

## Design Lab

Create your own DNA designs.

1. I have an idea for a happ/DNA.
2. I can pseudo-code it in blockly, or aggregate zomes from the library, and send it to you via a link.
3. You can review it and add comments, or also attacks.
4. You can also fork it and provide alternative ways of doing things.
5. We can compare ways of doing things side-by-side.

## Dojo

Problem statements, that the participant needs to satisfy with pseudo-code.

1. I want to train myself in holochain design.
2. I can browse different exercises for different use-cases and pick one.
3. In that exercise, you have to pseudo-code a solution that satisfies the requirements.

- When you are done with that exercise, maybe you get some points?
- In the future, maybe these exercises can be grouped together in courses?

## Library

Library of zomes, DNAs, etc., with blockly code.

- Maybe in the future you'll be able to upload `.wasm` zomes?

- [Gym](https://holochain-gym.github.com/): this is sort of the static simplifyied version of what this hApp would be. It will also provide a nice basic set of learning exercises before getting immersed in it.
